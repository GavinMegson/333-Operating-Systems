This reflects the 5 operating system projects I completed in spring 2018.

For more info on the xv6 operating system and how PSU uses it for their
courses, examine the README files in the subfolder.

The 5 project technical reports are listed in this folder as PDFs.

The final code (after submission but before implementing feedback) are
in the subfolder. The state of the code at each project can be determined
via the conditional compilation directives. The TAR of the original xv6
is included as well for reference.


Highlights of these projects include:

    - Working on a very large C project with expansive file dependencies
    - Debugging multi-threaded systems-level code with GDB
    - Implementing process state lists
    - Implementing multi-level feedback queues
    - Implementing filesystem permissions


Personal reflections:

    - I should have made better use of helper functions. Several times I
ended up writing custom linked list traversals for each process state
list, which was very inefficient and much less readable.
    - Operating systems aren't some magical box; they are actual code.
